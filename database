DATABASES
- There are many types of databases. But most fall under 2 categories SQL - Structured Query Language databases and NoSQL => Non Structured Query Language databases.
- PostgreSQL database => This is a type of SQL database.
- SQL commands are usually case insensitive but by convention we capitalize them. 
- Every SQL command ends with a semicolon ;.
- Creating a Database => Bigbaby=# CREATE DATABASE school;
- \c psql command to connect to the database
- creating Tables => Bigbaby=# CREATE TABLE courses (name varchar,full_time boolean);
         * varchar defines that all data stored in the column is will be a String. 
         * Boolean data type states all the data stored will be a boolean either True or False.
- Altering Tables => Bigbaby=# ALTER TABLE courses ADD student_number integer;
         We add an Integer column to the table where we can store the number of students taking the course.
- Droping columns => Bigbaby=# ALTER TABLE courses DROP student_number;
- Inserting into Table => Bigbaby=# INSERT INTO courses (name, full_time) VALUES ('Advanced Math',True);
- Retrieving data => Bigbaby=# SELECT name FROM courses ;
- Select all entries from the table => Bigbaby=# SELECT * FROM courses ; 
         The wildcard * tells psql to pick all the tables.
- Deleting data - Bigbaby=#  DELETE FROM courses * ;
- Adding a Primary Key => Bigbaby=# ALTER TABLE course ADD id serial PRIMARY KEY;
            A primary key is a unique identifier inside a table. It is assigned to a new row and is not repeated anywhere else in the table.
- Creating a Password => Bigbaby=# ALTER USER bigbaby password 'New Pasword'

Common SQL commands
- CREATE DATABASE database_name; # From the $USER database.
- CREATE TABLE table_name (id serial PRIMARY KEY, some_column varchar, another_column int);
- ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name boolean;
- ALTER TABLE table_name DROP column_name;
- SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE id >= 3;
- SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE NOT id >= 5;
- UPDATE courses SET name = 'Poetry' WHERE id = 2;
- DROP TABLE table_name; # From the database that holds the table.
- DROP DATABASE test_database; # From the $USER database.

Postgresql commands
         *List all databases: \l.
         * Exit out of help menu: \q
         * Connect to database: \c database_name
         * List tables in current database: \dt
         * List columns in a table: \d table_name
         * See a list of all psql commands: \? (Press the down arrow to scroll through, or q to exit list.)

SQLAlchemy
- SQLAlchemy is an Object relational mapper that allows us to create a mapping between the database and the Python Objects in our application. 
- It allows us to interact with the database using Python objects that will be translated and mapped into SQL statements.
