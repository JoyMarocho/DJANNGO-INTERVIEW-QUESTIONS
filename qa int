Given API testing has been introduced to the current scope, I'd take the following steps. 
Foremost, I would focus on selecting the best tool for testing the APIs. The first step in selecting the best tool would involve gathering the requirements and identifying constraints. I believe this would help me understand the requirements for searching the appropriate. For instance, SOAP APIs would need different tools from REST APIs. Additionally, knowing the type of tests being performed, either functional, performance, or security testing can enhance the decision making process. 
The second step would be evaluating the available tools in the firm. This would help in shortlisting tools that meet the requirements, as well as, facilitate the recommendation of tools that would not be in the firm. The third step would include would be providing the proof of concept by implementing a subset of the tests with the shortlisted tools and presenting the findings to the stakeholders. Once the stakeholders are satisfied, the final step would be implementing the tool, creating and executing tests comprehensively, and reporting defects if any.
