10. WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS TYPES OF MOBILE APPLICATIONS?
- There are three types of mobile applications: mobile web, native app, and hybrid app. The classification is based on development efforts and app redistribution strategy. Let us understand each of them in detail.

11. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A WEB APP, NATIVE APP, AND HYBRID APP?
a) Web Apps:
- Web applications are not real applications; They are websites that open on your smartphone with the help of a web browser. Mobile websites have a wide audience of all primary types of applications.
         * Example – Great Education
         * Benefits – Easy access.
         * Easy development.
         * Easy update
         * Downside – Access to file systems and local resources is not available on websites.
         * Many existing websites do not support offline capabilities.
         * The website only needs to be opened in a web browser.
While native and hybrid apps appear on the App Store and Google Play, web apps will not. Therefore, redistribution is not so sensible.

b) Native Apps:
- A native app has been developed specifically for one platform. It can be installed through an application store (such as the Google Play Store or Apple’s App Store).
         Examples – Whatsapp, Facebook.
             * Benefits – Can be accessed via the original application icon.
             * They can take full advantage of all device features – camera, GPS, accelerometer, compass, list of contacts, and so on.
             * Can use the device’s notification system and work offline.
             * The best user experience.
             * As it is found in the App Store, redistribution is easy.
         Downsides:
            * High cost for the creation of the app.
            * Maintenance is high.
c) Hybrid App:
- These apps are a way of exposing content from existing websites in an app format. They can be described as a mixture of web apps and native apps.

         Examples – Instagram, Wikipedia.
                  * Benefit –
                  * It is cheaper to develop a hybrid app than to develop a native app. It can be built for cross-platform use.
                  * Maintenance is simple, as there are not many versions to maintain.
                  * It can take advantage of some features available on the device.
                  * It can be found in the App Store, making delivery easier.
                  * It only has a browser embedded within the app.
         Downside:
             * Graphics are less accustomed to operating systems than native apps.
             * Hybrid apps are slower than native apps.
             
12. WHAT IS MOBILE DEVICE TESTING?

- When we call it instrument testing, hardware becomes a part of testing. In the case of mobile application testing, it depends, that is, if hardware integration is required for the application under test, then hardware testing will be involved.
- Automation is possible for mobile device testing as well as mobile application testing.

15. WHAT ARE A SIMULATOR AND AN EMULATOR?
- Simulator: It is an electronic network simulation tool or base station tool for CDMA / CMA mobile phones. It can and does help with home network latching without roaming services; Data call, SMS,
- Emulator: This is software for testing mobile apps without a live handset

16. WHY DO WE NEED AN EMULATOR/SIMULATOR?
- If we are developing an application. Once the product is fully developed, as a part of mobile testing, we need to see if the application works with all major devices such as Android phones, iOS, Blackberry phones, and other different types of tablets and iPads. Is working as expected. To perform this type of investigation, we need to obtain each device which is very expensive to purchase and test such a large number of mobile devices. To solve this problem, we need a simulator/emulator.

17. HOW IS TESTING DONE ON AN EMULATOR/SIMULATOR DIFFERENT FROM TESTING ON A REAL DEVICE?
> Real Device:
         * You have to spend a lot to get a real device
         * It has a fast processing speed
         * Network latency may be normal
         * Debugging is not so easy
         * Web applications can be tested in the usual way
         * It always gives accurate results
> Emulator / Emulation:
         * It is almost free
         * It is slower than real devices
         * It has lower latency than actual devices
         * It provides step-by-step debugging of the application
         * Web applications are very easy to test
         * It cannot simulate all types of user interactions; So it can sometimes give wrong results.
         * It scores low when it comes to reliability.

18. WHAT FEATURES CANNOT WE TEST ON A SIMULATOR/EMULATOR?
- A simulator/emulator cannot mimic the following features –
         * Mobile device battery
         * Mobile device camera

         * Incoming and outgoing SMS and MMS
         * Incoming and outgoing calls
         * Incoming notifications
         * Battery drain
         * Cable Entry and Removal for Data Transfer

22. WHAT IS A USABILITY TEST?
- Usability testing evaluates the application based on the following criteria for the efficiency of the target audience.:
         * Effectiveness
         * Satisfaction
- It is very important to get usability testing in place from the initial stage of application design, and this should not be done only when the application is completed. Usability testing requires excessive involvement of users, and output can affect application design, which is very difficult to change in later stages of the project.

23. WHAT ARE INSTALLATION TESTS AND UNINSTALL TESTS?
- Installation testing verifies that the installation process goes smoothly without the user experiencing any difficulty. The uninstall test can be summarized in one line because “uninstalling should sweep the app-related data only once”.

24. WHAT IS AN UPDATE TEST?
- We need to be very cautious about mobile app updates. People often complain about applications not working satisfactorily after an update. Therefore, it is very important that under update testing, we ensure that the app was working before. In short, it should not break anything. Mobile application updates can occur in two ways – automatic update and manual update.

25. WHAT IS A CERTIFICATION TEST?
- To obtain a certificate of compliance, each mobile device needs to be tested against the guidelines set by various mobile platforms.

26. WHAT IS A UI TEST?
- In this type of testing, we check the user experience to ensure that we provide an excellent experience to our users, mobile UI testing is highly recommended.
- It is your job as a tester to confirm that your application meets certain expectations, such as –
         * Overall color scheme/theme of the device
         * Style and color of the mouse
         * The progress indicator on page loading
         * Menus and how they are implemented and are specific items
         * The overall response of applications on this device
         * Screen orientation / resolution.

27. WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF UI VERIFICATION TOOLS?
        The script:

              * Enter the website under Test and click Go. Select the mobile device on which you want to view the website.
        Browserstack:
             * This is another great tool for testing the mobile UI. It provides amazing results. Although it is a payment tool, you can take advantage of the free trial by registering on BrowserStack with a valid email address.

28. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MULTI-TOUCH AND SINGLE TOUCH SCREEN?
- If your devices and applications support multi-touch features, such as pinch-to-zoom effects on iPhones, be sure to include plenty of test cases involving touching the screen in multiple locations simultaneously, especially when using a soft Typing on the keyboard.

29. DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN LONG TOUCH AND SHORT TOUCH?
- While there is no concept of double-clicking on touch screen devices (although your application can be implemented specifically), some devices such as Android smartphones distinguish between long touch and short touch. Pressing and holding an item will bring up a context menu in the middle of the screen while clicking on the same item will automatically perform the first task in that context menu.

30. WHAT IS TEST PLANNING?
Preparing to test mobile devices.
- Methods and tools continue to be developed to facilitate usability testing on phones and tablets.
- When planning a mobile device test, you should keep the following points in mind-

        * Circuit board / CPU
        * Touch screen display
        * Memory card
        * Sim Card
        * The battery
        
33. HOW DIFFERENT IS A CAPACITIVE TOUCHSCREEN?
> Resistive touchscreen – It consists of two layers that form an overlay on the screen. When the finger is placed at any point on the screen, the two forms receive contact and coordination. These are relatively inexpensive and are found right on most budget phones. The downside is that a certain amount of pressure is required to enter the touch. As time passes, there is some degree of damage to the screen.
> Capacitive touchscreen – The entire screen is coated with a capacitive material that carries a certain amount of electric charge. When an operating object is placed on the screen like a finger, the capacitance changes at that point, and thus the coordinates are obtained.

34. WHAT ARE THE OTHER WAYS TO TEST MOBILE DEVICES?
- Some tests are available as apps for both iOS and Android platforms. To use them you have to download the desired app. Then follow the instructions to run the exam and save your result.
Test speed equipment

48. ENCOUNTERED ISSUES WITH CROSS-PLATFORM TESTING?
- Generally, the issue depends on different OS/device versions, it can do the same thing while working on one OS, while it may not work on another version. For example, we encountered a problem that our application was working fine on iOS 6.x version devices, but some modules were exploited when the application crashed on iOS 5.x devices and the same happened with 2.3.5

49. WHAT ARE COMMON BUGS FOUND DURING THE MOBILE TESTING PROCESS?
- In general, some mobile testers classify the most frequently found insects into four types:
         * Critical bug: The operating system of the device crashes while testing a particular feature of the application.
         * Block bug: Non-equalization of the display occurs even when the state of the device is still on.
         * Major bug: A distinguishing feature of the application is its inability to demonstrate its functionality.
         * Minor bugs: GUI bugs are usually the main case of falling into a minor bug list.
Additionally, some other types of bugs are also found during the mobile application testing process, for example:
         > Slow performance of an application
         > Battery consumption by an application
         > Completely unresponsive behavior of an application
         
50. WHEN SHOULD THE QA TEAM CHOOSE MANUAL TESTS OR AUTOMATION TESTS FOR THEIR MOBILE TESTING PROJECTS?
