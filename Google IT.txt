- The Internet is just an interconnection of computers around the world.
 The Internet is the physical connection of computers and wires around the world. The Web is the information on the Internet.
- The interconnection of computers is a Network
-  managing, building and designing networks is known as networking .
-Servers store the websites that we use, like Wikipedia, Google, Reddit, and BBC. These websites serve content
- Computers on a network have an identifier called an IP address. An IP address is composed of digits and numbers like 100.1.4.3.
- Devices that can connect to a network have another unique identifier called a MAC address. MAC addresses are generally permanent and hard-coded onto a device.
- packets is data that is sent through a network is sent through 

ways you can connect computers to a network
         - Ethernet cable, which lets you physically connect to the network through a cable. 
         - Wi-Fi, which is wireless networking. 
         - Fiber optic cables to connect to a network. This is the most expensive method since fiber optic cables allow greater speeds than all the other methods.
- router connects lots of different devices together and helps route network traffic. 
Switches and hubs are also devices that help our data travel. 

Two Network protocols
- The Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP for short, which have become the predominant protocols of the Internet.

IP ADDRESS
1. Internet Protocol version four or IPv4 - is an address that consists of 32 bits separated into four groups.
- Its the current Protocol,
2. IPv6 or Internet Protocol version six addresses - consists of a 128 bits, four times the amount that IPv4 uses.
3. NAT or Network Address Translation - This lets organizations use one public IP address and many private IP addresses within the network.

TCP/IP; The TCP/IP protocol is what allowed computers to share information outside their network, which stemmed the creation of the Internet as we know it today.
